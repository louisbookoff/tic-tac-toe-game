# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

## Project Scope
For this project, we were tasked with building a front-end tic-tac-toe application and integrate that will a pre-built API.  The application must follow SPA or 'Sing Page Application' requirements.

## Technology Stack
This application was built with the following languages:
- html
- css
- javascript
- back-end api was built, but was tasked with setting up API calls based on a series of requirements

## Phase One-Planning
The first phase of development was the planning phase.  Utilizing my knowledge from class exercises, I created a series of user stories and wire frames, presenting my ideal UI and UX of my game user.  These planning materials serve as a foundation and guide throughout the development process. In addition,  I worked on outlining my development schedule and prioritzing those user stories based on must have's and nice to have's.  This allowed me to remain on track in pursuit of functionality first.

## Phase Two- Game Logic and Engine
To start, this phase was rather difficult.  I think with most new things, one of the hardest aspects is figuring out where to start.  This was definitely the case here.  Although I had played tic-tac-toe quite a bit, I couldn't begin to imagine the extensive elements that would go into such a game.  One I got started, I was able to hit the ground rolling and come up with an independent functioning game engine, meaning I could play the game without the board. What I found later on is that my Game Engine would change dramatically, as I iterated on my UI and found different methods for doing what I initially did in the game logic.  For me, this allowed me to make my code significantly more DRY than it was previously, thus making it easier to understand for other developers.  One barrier for me was that I was scared to break code that I had previously written, however through development I became more comfortable iterating on previously written code.

## Phase Three- API Authentication
For this aspect, I was able leverage previous assignments significantly and got through this phase rather quickly.  It was interesting to really devle deeper into understanding what goes in to things that seem so simple as signing in to an application.

## Phase Four- Game UI
I spent a majority of my development time on this phase.  Like the initial game enginge I struggled with where to start and also ended up toying around with few different strategies.  This phase was also where I derailed my clean commit history and would switch from feature to feature without even thinking about it. That is something I need to do better, making sure I focus just on the task at hand and maybe utilize my own issue queue as a reminder for later of what are other elements I need to fix.

## Phase Five- Game API
The first task, of creating a new game was rather simple, however what I hit a huge barrier on was the patch-update game request.  This was a huge time-suck during the development process and took signifciantly longer than I initially expected.  I utilized the class issue queue significantly during this process, as I had difficulty leveraging previous examples we had done.  With each one I got a little more confident in how to execute

## Other Notes
Things left to do:
I struggled to find an appropriate method to prevent duplicate clicks.  I believe this is the only thing preventing me from passing requirements.  I used the .off method, however upon creating a new game I could no long click on the boxes.  I realize I must use .on, but tried that in various ways for countless hours and could not get it to work.

Things to improve:
- Design
- UX
- The game engine could always be cleaner
- Seperation of Concerns
- Commit Messages
- Ensuring focused on one feature at a time.
